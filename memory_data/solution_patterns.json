This helps to get rid of the constant term (+7) on the same side as the variable. So, we have: 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7, which simplifies to 3x = 15. Step 2: Divide both sides by the coefficient of x (which is 3 in this case) to solve for x. This step uses the concept of inverse operations, where dividing by 3 is the inverse of multiplying by 3. So, we have: 3x / 3 = 15 / 3, which simplifies to x = 5. Step 3: Verify our solution by substituting x = 5 back into the original equation: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22.

So, subtracting 8 from both sides gives us: 5x = 23 - 8, which simplifies to 5x = 15. Step 2: Now that we have isolated the term with the variable, we need to solve for x.

However, the provided formula P(Ace) = 4/52 = 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt] gives the probability of drawing any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. For the ace of hearts, considering it as a specific event within the aces, the calculation directly relates to the total number of cards and the specific card we're interested in.\n\nThe correct approach to finding the probability of drawing the ace of hearts involves recognizing it as a specific card out of the total. The formula provided in the retrieved knowledge for the probability of an ace (P(Ace) = 4/52) doesn't directly apply to finding the probability of a specific ace (like the ace of hearts) without considering the total number of cards and the fact that there's only one ace of hearts.\n\nGiven the information and correcting the approach: \n- The probability of drawing any ace is 4/52 (since there are 4 aces), which simplifies to 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- However, for the specific ace of hearts, since there's only 1 such card in a deck of 52, the probability calculation should reflect the chance of drawing this one specific card out of the total.\n\nThe computed result provided (1/13 \u2248 0.0769) seems to misinterpret the application of the formula for the specific case of drawing the ace of hearts. The correct calculation for the probability of drawing the ace of hearts, given it's a single specific card out of 52, should directly consider the total number of cards and that there's only one ace of hearts.\n\nThus, the probability of drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of cards, considering the correct interpretation and calculation, should be 1 (the ace of hearts) out of 52 (total cards), which is 1/52.\n\nThe confusion arises from the provided formula and computed result, which seems to mix the probability of drawing any ace with the specific case of the ace of hearts. The correct step-by-step calculation focuses on the specific card (ace of hearts) and the total number of cards in the deck. \n\nHowever, following the strict instruction to use only the formulas from the retrieved knowledge and given the context provided:\n- The probability of drawing an ace (any ace) is correctly given as 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The question asks for the probability of the ace of hearts, which implies a specific outcome within the set of all aces.\n\nGiven this, and adhering strictly to the provided formulas without further derivation:\nThe probability calculation provided (1/13) seems to be a general probability for any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. The correct approach, based on the information given and the formulas provided, should consider the specific case, but the direct calculation for the ace of hearts (1 out of 52) isn't directly derived from the given formulas without recognizing the specific card's probability as 1/52. \n\nFor clarity and following the instruction to use the provided formulas directly:\n- The probability of an ace (any) is 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The implication for a specific ace (like the ace of hearts) involves recognizing it as one of the four aces, but the direct calculation from the given formulas isn't straightforward without considering the total number of cards and the specificity of the ace of hearts.\n\nThe final answer, based on the direct calculation for a specific card (ace of hearts) out of the total, should reflect the chance of drawing that one card, which is 1 out of 52, or 1/52. However, the provided computed result and formula suggest a different interpretation that doesn't directly apply to the specific case of the ace of hearts without considering the total number of cards and the uniqueness of the ace of hearts. \n\nTo correct and clarify, based on the standard probability calculation for a specific event (drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of 52 cards), the probability is 1/52, not directly derived from the provided formulas but from the basic principle of probability for a specific outcome. \n\nGiven the strict format and instruction to follow the provided formulas and the confusion in the explanation:\nThe correct calculation, following basic probability principles for a specific card, is 1/52, but this explanation aimed to clarify the step-by-step process based on the provided formulas and retrieved knowledge.",

    "solution_approach": "Step 1: To find the maximum volume of the box, we first need to understand how the volume of the box is related to the side length of the square cut off from each corner. Let's denote the side length of the square cut off as 'x'. After cutting off the squares, the new side length of the box will be 18 - 2x, and the height of the box will be x. Step 2: The volume of the box (V) can be calculated using the formula V = length * width * height. Since the box is made from a square piece of tin, the length and width will be the same, so V = (18 - 2x) * (18 - 2x) * x. Step 3: To maximize the volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x) = (18 - 2x)^2 * x. This involves taking the derivative of V(x) with respect to x, setting it equal to zero, and solving for x. The derivative of V(x) is dV/dx = (18 - 2x)^2 - 4x(18 - 2x). Setting dV/dx = 0 gives us (18 - 2x)^2 - 4x(18 - 2x) = 0. Step 4: Solving this equation will give us the value of x that maximizes the volume of the box.

So, we can break down the expression into two separate terms: `p\u2074` and `5p`. Step 2: Next, we apply the POWER RULE to the first term `p\u2074`. The POWER RULE states that if we have a term like `x^n`, its derivative is `n * x^(n-1)`. In this case, `n` is 4, so the derivative of `p\u2074` is `4 * p^(4-1) = 4 * p\u00b3`.

    "solution_approach": "The chain rule of derivatives is a fundamental concept in calculus that helps us find the derivative of a composite function. A composite function is a function of the form f(g(x)), where f and g are two separate functions.\n\n**What is the Chain Rule?**\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function f(g(x)) is given by the product of the derivatives of the individual functions, i.e., f'(g(x)) and g'(x). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nd/dx (f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) [Source: Differentiation Rules (JEE Level)]\n\nor, in a more intuitive notation:\n\ndy/dx = dy/du \u00d7 du/dx\n\nwhere u = g(x) and y = f(u).\n\n**How Does the Chain Rule Work?**\n\nTo understand the chain rule, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we want to find the derivative of the function sin(x^2). We can think of this function as a composite function, where the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = x^2.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can write:\n\nd/dx (sin(x^2)) = d/du (sin(u)) * d/du (x^2)\n\nNow, we know that the derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation above:\n\nd/dx (sin(x^2)) = cos(x^2) * 2x\n\nThis is the final answer, which shows that the derivative of sin(x^2) is indeed cos(x^2) * 2x.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's work out another example to illustrate the chain rule. Suppose we want to find the derivative of the function e^(3x). We can think of this function as a composite function, where the outer function is e^u and the inner function is u = 3x.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can write:\n\nd/dx (e^(3x)) = d/du (e^u) * d/du (3x)\n\nNow, we know that the derivative of e^u with respect to u is e^u, and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation above:\n\nd/dx (e^(3x)) = e^(3x) * 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nd/dx (e^(3x)) = 3e^(3x)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the chain rule is a powerful tool for finding the derivatives of composite functions. By applying the chain rule, we can break down complex functions into simpler components and find their derivatives more easily. Remember to always identify the outer and inner functions, and then apply the chain rule formula: dy/dx = dy/du \u00d7 du/dx.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the chain rule of derivatives!
