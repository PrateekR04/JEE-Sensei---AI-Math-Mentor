Step 3: Calculate the discriminant, D = b\u00b2 - 4ac, which determines the nature of the roots. Here, D = 5\u00b2 - 4*1*6 = 25 - 24 = 1. Since D > 0, the equation has two real and distinct roots.

We can write this as an equation: f = s + 30, where f is the father's age and s is the son's age. Step 2: Next, we are given that in 5 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. We can write this as another equation: f + 5 = 2*(s + 5). Step 3: Now, we simplify the second equation by multiplying out the right side: f + 5 = 2s + 10. Then, we subtract 5 from both sides to get: f = 2s + 5. Step 4: Since both equations are equal to f, we can set them equal to each other: s + 30 = 2s + 5. Step 5: To solve for s, we need to get all the s terms on one side. We subtract s from both sides: 30 = s + 5. Then, we subtract 5 from both sides: 25 = s. Step 6: Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find f. Using the first equation: f = s + 30, we get f = 25 + 30, so f = 55.",

To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 5. This is the inverse operation of multiplication, and it helps us to 'get rid' of the coefficient. So, dividing both sides by 5 gives us: x = 15 / 5, which simplifies to x = 3. Step 3: To verify our solution, we can substitute x = 3 back into the original equation. This helps us to check if our solution is correct. Substituting x = 3 into the equation 5x + 8 = 23 gives us: 5(3) + 8 = 15 + 8 = 23, which confirms that our solution is correct.",

Step 3: Now, we apply the formula for probability, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing an ace, and the total possible outcomes are the total number of cards in the deck. Step 4: Using the formula P(Ace) = Number of aces / Total number of cards, we can substitute the values to get P(Ace) = 4/52. Step 5: Finally, we simplify the fraction 4/52 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4, to get P(Ace) = 1/13.",

Therefore, P(Ace) = 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n\nHowever, the question asks for the probability of an ace of clubs, not just any ace. Since there's only one ace of clubs in the deck:\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of drawing the ace of clubs.\nGiven that there's only 1 ace of clubs and there are 52 cards in total, the probability of drawing the ace of clubs is 1/52.\n\nBut, if we consider the given formula P(ace) = 4/52 = 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt], it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the computed result provided, as this formula calculates the probability of any ace, not specifically the ace of clubs. For the ace of clubs, the correct calculation based on the information provided should indeed consider it as one specific card out of 52.\n\nThus, the correct probability calculation for the ace of clubs, based on the information given and standard probability formulas, should be 1 out of 52, not 1/13, which applies to the probability of drawing any ace. \n\nThe computed result 1/13 (\u2248 0.0769) seems to be based on the probability of drawing any ace, not specifically the ace of clubs [Source: probability_basics.txt].

    "solution_steps": "**From Memory:** This problem is very similar to one I've solved before.\n\nStep 1: To solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13, we need to isolate the term with the variable (x). We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This is because when we add or subtract the same value to both sides of an equation, the equation remains balanced. So, 2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5, which simplifies to 2x = 8. Step 2: Now that we have 2x = 8, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 2.

    "solution_steps": "To calculate the probability of drawing an ace of hearts from a deck of cards, we need to understand the basic principles of probability. \n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of cards in a standard deck. \nAccording to [Source: probability_basics.txt], a standard deck contains 52 cards.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of aces in the deck. \nAs stated in [Source: probability_basics.txt], there are 4 aces in a standard deck (one for each suit: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of drawing an ace from the deck. \nUsing the information from [Source: probability_basics.txt], the probability of drawing an ace (P(Ace)) is given by the formula: P(Ace) = 4/52 = 1/13.\n\nStep 4: Since we are looking for the probability of drawing a specific ace (the ace of hearts), we need to consider that there is only 1 ace of hearts in the deck. \nGiven that there are 4 aces and each has an equal chance of being drawn, the probability of drawing the ace of hearts is the probability of drawing any ace divided by the number of aces, but since the ace of hearts is a specific card, its probability is directly related to the total number of cards.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability of drawing the ace of hearts. \nSince there is only 1 ace of hearts in a deck of 52 cards, the probability is 1 (favorable outcome) out of 52 (total possible outcomes). However, the provided formula P(Ace) = 4/52 = 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt] gives the probability of drawing any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. For the ace of hearts, considering it as a specific event within the aces, the calculation directly relates to the total number of cards and the specific card we're interested in.\n\nThe correct approach to finding the probability of drawing the ace of hearts involves recognizing it as a specific card out of the total. The formula provided in the retrieved knowledge for the probability of an ace (P(Ace) = 4/52) doesn't directly apply to finding the probability of a specific ace (like the ace of hearts) without considering the total number of cards and the fact that there's only one ace of hearts.\n\nGiven the information and correcting the approach: \n- The probability of drawing any ace is 4/52 (since there are 4 aces), which simplifies to 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- However, for the specific ace of hearts, since there's only 1 such card in a deck of 52, the probability calculation should reflect the chance of drawing this one specific card out of the total.\n\nThe computed result provided (1/13 \u2248 0.0769) seems to misinterpret the application of the formula for the specific case of drawing the ace of hearts. The correct calculation for the probability of drawing the ace of hearts, given it's a single specific card out of 52, should directly consider the total number of cards and that there's only one ace of hearts.\n\nThus, the probability of drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of cards, considering the correct interpretation and calculation, should be 1 (the ace of hearts) out of 52 (total cards), which is 1/52.\n\nThe confusion arises from the provided formula and computed result, which seems to mix the probability of drawing any ace with the specific case of the ace of hearts. The correct step-by-step calculation focuses on the specific card (ace of hearts) and the total number of cards in the deck. \n\nHowever, following the strict instruction to use only the formulas from the retrieved knowledge and given the context provided:\n- The probability of drawing an ace (any ace) is correctly given as 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The question asks for the probability of the ace of hearts, which implies a specific outcome within the set of all aces.\n\nGiven this, and adhering strictly to the provided formulas without further derivation:\nThe probability calculation provided (1/13) seems to be a general probability for any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. The correct approach, based on the information given and the formulas provided, should consider the specific case, but the direct calculation for the ace of hearts (1 out of 52) isn't directly derived from the given formulas without recognizing the specific card's probability as 1/52. \n\nFor clarity and following the instruction to use the provided formulas directly:\n- The probability of an ace (any) is 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The implication for a specific ace (like the ace of hearts) involves recognizing it as one of the four aces, but the direct calculation from the given formulas isn't straightforward without considering the total number of cards and the specificity of the ace of hearts.\n\nThe final answer, based on the direct calculation for a specific card (ace of hearts) out of the total, should reflect the chance of drawing that one card, which is 1 out of 52, or 1/52. However, the provided computed result and formula suggest a different interpretation that doesn't directly apply to the specific case of the ace of hearts without considering the total number of cards and the uniqueness of the ace of hearts. \n\nTo correct and clarify, based on the standard probability calculation for a specific event (drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of 52 cards), the probability is 1/52, not directly derived from the provided formulas but from the basic principle of probability for a specific outcome. \n\nGiven the strict format and instruction to follow the provided formulas and the confusion in the explanation:\nThe correct calculation, following basic probability principles for a specific card, is 1/52, but this explanation aimed to clarify the step-by-step process based on the provided formulas and retrieved knowledge.",

However, the provided formula P(Ace) = 4/52 = 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt] gives the probability of drawing any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. For the ace of hearts, considering it as a specific event within the aces, the calculation directly relates to the total number of cards and the specific card we're interested in.\n\nThe correct approach to finding the probability of drawing the ace of hearts involves recognizing it as a specific card out of the total.

The correct calculation for the probability of drawing the ace of hearts, given it's a single specific card out of 52, should directly consider the total number of cards and that there's only one ace of hearts.\n\nThus, the probability of drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of cards, considering the correct interpretation and calculation, should be 1 (the ace of hearts) out of 52 (total cards), which is 1/52.\n\nThe confusion arises from the provided formula and computed result, which seems to mix the probability of drawing any ace with the specific case of the ace of hearts. The correct step-by-step calculation focuses on the specific card (ace of hearts) and the total number of cards in the deck. \n\nHowever, following the strict instruction to use only the formulas from the retrieved knowledge and given the context provided:\n- The probability of drawing an ace (any ace) is correctly given as 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The question asks for the probability of the ace of hearts, which implies a specific outcome within the set of all aces.\n\nGiven this, and adhering strictly to the provided formulas without further derivation:\nThe probability calculation provided (1/13) seems to be a general probability for any ace, not specifically the ace of hearts. The correct approach, based on the information given and the formulas provided, should consider the specific case, but the direct calculation for the ace of hearts (1 out of 52) isn't directly derived from the given formulas without recognizing the specific card's probability as 1/52. \n\nFor clarity and following the instruction to use the provided formulas directly:\n- The probability of an ace (any) is 1/13 [Source: probability_basics.txt].\n- The implication for a specific ace (like the ace of hearts) involves recognizing it as one of the four aces, but the direct calculation from the given formulas isn't straightforward without considering the total number of cards and the specificity of the ace of hearts.\n\nThe final answer, based on the direct calculation for a specific card (ace of hearts) out of the total, should reflect the chance of drawing that one card, which is 1 out of 52, or 1/52. However, the provided computed result and formula suggest a different interpretation that doesn't directly apply to the specific case of the ace of hearts without considering the total number of cards and the uniqueness of the ace of hearts. \n\nTo correct and clarify, based on the standard probability calculation for a specific event (drawing the ace of hearts from a deck of 52 cards), the probability is 1/52, not directly derived from the provided formulas but from the basic principle of probability for a specific outcome. \n\nGiven the strict format and instruction to follow the provided formulas and the confusion in the explanation:\nThe correct calculation, following basic probability principles for a specific card, is 1/52, but this explanation aimed to clarify the step-by-step process based on the provided formulas and retrieved knowledge.",

In this case, n = 3, so the derivative of x^3 is 3 * x^(3-1) = 3x^2.\n\nStep 3: Apply the differentiation rule to the second term.\nThe second term is a constant, 1. According to the CONSTANT RULE [Source: differentiation_rules.txt], the derivative of a constant is 0, so the derivative of 1 is 0.\n\nStep 4: Combine the derivatives of the individual components using the SUM/DIFFERENCE RULE [Source: differentiation_rules.txt].\nThe SUM/DIFFERENCE RULE states that d/dx (f(x) \u00b1 g(x)) = d/dx (f(x)) \u00b1 d/dx (g(x)). In this case, we have d/dx (x^3 + 1) = d/dx (x^3) + d/dx (1) = 3x^2 + 0 = 3x^2.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of \"x cube plus one\" is 3x^2. The computed result \"3*E*l*n*o*p*s*u*x**2\" seems to be incorrect, possibly due to a mistake in the calculation or a misunderstanding of the expression [Source: common_mistakes_calculus.txt].

However, we can use imaginary numbers to represent the square root of a negative number.\n3. To find the square root of -8, we can rewrite -8 as -1 * 8.\n4. Using the property of square roots, we can write \u221a(-8) = \u221a(-1 * 8) = \u221a(-1) * \u221a8.\n5. We know that \u221a(-1) is represented by the imaginary unit 'i', where i\u00b2 = -1.\n6. So, \u221a(-1) = i.\n7. Now, we need to find the square root of 8. We can factor 8 as 4 * 2, where 4 is a perfect square.\n8. Using the property of square roots, we can write \u221a8 = \u221a(4 * 2) = \u221a4 * \u221a2 = 2\u221a2.\n9. Therefore, \u221a(-8) = i * 2\u221a2 = 2i\u221a2.",

    "final_answer": "To solve the equation 2x + 5 = 7, we will follow the step-by-step method provided in the retrieved knowledge.\n\nFirst, we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable. According to the retrieved knowledge, \"1. Subtract b from both sides: ax = c - b\" [Source: algebra_linear.txt]. In this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 7. So, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2x + 5 - 5 = 7 - 5\n2x = 2\n\nThis step is based on the concept of subtracting the constant term from both sides to isolate the variable term [Source: algebra_linear.txt].\n\nNext, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of x, which is 2. The retrieved knowledge states, \"2. Divide both sides by a: x = (c - b) / a\" [Source: algebra_linear.txt]. In this case, a = 2, c = 7, and b = 5. So, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n2x / 2 = 2 / 2\nx = 1\n\nThis step is based on the concept of dividing both sides by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable [Source: algebra_linear.txt].\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 7 is x = 1.\n\nTo verify our solution, we can substitute x = 1 back into the original equation:\n\n2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThis verification step is based on the concept of substituting the solution back into the original equation to check its validity [Source: algebra_linear.txt].\n\nThe final answer is x = 1.",
    "solution_steps": "**From Memory:** This problem is very similar to one I've solved before.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation 2x + 5 = 7 to isolate the term with the variable. This gives us 2x = 2, because when we subtract 5 from both sides, the 5's cancel out. Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation 2x = 2 by 2 to solve for x. This gives us x = 1, because when we divide 2 by 2, we get 1. Step 3: Verify our solution by substituting x = 1 back into the original equation 2x + 5 = 7. When we plug in x = 1, we get 2(1) + 5 = 7, which is true.",

Let's denote the side length of the square cut off as 'x'. After cutting off the squares, the new side length of the box will be 18 - 2x, and the height of the box will be x. Step 2: The volume of the box (V) can be calculated using the formula V = length * width * height. Since the box is made from a square piece of tin, the length and width will be the same, so V = (18 - 2x) * (18 - 2x) * x. Step 3: To maximize the volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x) = (18 - 2x)^2 * x. This involves taking the derivative of V(x) with respect to x, setting it equal to zero, and solving for x. The derivative of V(x) is dV/dx = (18 - 2x)^2 - 4x(18 - 2x). Setting dV/dx = 0 gives us (18 - 2x)^2 - 4x(18 - 2x) = 0. Step 4: Solving this equation will give us the value of x that maximizes the volume of the box.
