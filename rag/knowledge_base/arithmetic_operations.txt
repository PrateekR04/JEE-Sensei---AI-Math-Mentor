Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+):
Definition: Combining two or more numbers to get a sum.
Example: 5 + 3 = 8
Properties:
- Commutative: a + b = b + a
- Associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Identity: a + 0 = a

Subtraction (-):
Definition: Finding the difference between two numbers.
Example: 10 - 4 = 6
Note: Subtraction is NOT commutative (a - b ≠ b - a)

Multiplication (×):
Definition: Repeated addition of a number.
Example: 4 × 3 = 12 (same as 4 + 4 + 4)
Properties:
- Commutative: a × b = b × a
- Associative: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
- Identity: a × 1 = a
- Zero property: a × 0 = 0
- Distributive: a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c

Division (÷):
Definition: Splitting a number into equal parts.
Example: 15 ÷ 3 = 5
Components: Dividend ÷ Divisor = Quotient
Note: Division by zero is undefined

Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
1. Parentheses / Brackets
2. Exponents / Orders
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

Example: 2 + 3 × 4
Step 1: 3 × 4 = 12
Step 2: 2 + 12 = 14
Answer: 14

Example: (2 + 3) × 4
Step 1: 2 + 3 = 5
Step 2: 5 × 4 = 20
Answer: 20
