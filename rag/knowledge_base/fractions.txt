Fractions

Definition:
A fraction represents a part of a whole.
Form: a/b where a is numerator and b is denominator (b ≠ 0)

Types of Fractions:
- Proper fraction: numerator < denominator (e.g., 3/4)
- Improper fraction: numerator ≥ denominator (e.g., 5/3)
- Mixed number: whole number + fraction (e.g., 1 2/3)

Converting Mixed to Improper:
Example: 2 3/4 = (2×4 + 3)/4 = 11/4

Converting Improper to Mixed:
Example: 11/4 = 2 remainder 3 = 2 3/4

Simplifying Fractions:
Divide numerator and denominator by their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Example: 12/18 = (12÷6)/(18÷6) = 2/3

Adding Fractions:
Same denominator: a/c + b/c = (a+b)/c
Example: 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

Different denominators: Find LCD (Least Common Denominator)
Example: 1/3 + 1/4
LCD = 12
= 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Subtracting Fractions:
Same denominator: a/c - b/c = (a-b)/c
Example: 5/8 - 3/8 = 2/8 = 1/4

Multiplying Fractions:
(a/b) × (c/d) = (a×c)/(b×d)
Example: 2/3 × 4/5 = 8/15

Dividing Fractions:
(a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c) = (a×d)/(b×c)
Example: 2/3 ÷ 4/5 = 2/3 × 5/4 = 10/12 = 5/6

Fraction to Decimal:
Divide numerator by denominator
1/2 = 0.5
1/4 = 0.25
3/4 = 0.75
1/5 = 0.2
1/3 = 0.333... (repeating)
2/3 = 0.666... (repeating)

Decimal to Fraction:
0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4
0.125 = 125/1000 = 1/8
