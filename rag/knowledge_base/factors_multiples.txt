Factors and Multiples

Factors:
Numbers that divide evenly into another number.
Example: Factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Finding Factors:
1. Start with 1 and the number itself
2. Check each number up to the square root

Factors of Common Numbers:
6: 1, 2, 3, 6
8: 1, 2, 4, 8
10: 1, 2, 5, 10
12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
15: 1, 3, 5, 15
18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30
36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

Prime Numbers:
Numbers with exactly two factors (1 and itself).
First 25 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
Note: 2 is the only even prime number.

Prime Factorization:
Breaking a number into product of primes.
Example: 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3 × 5
Example: 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 2² × 3 × 7

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) / HCF (Highest Common Factor):
Largest number that divides both numbers.
Method: Prime factorization, take common primes with lowest exponents.
Example: GCD of 12 and 18
12 = 2² × 3
18 = 2 × 3²
GCD = 2 × 3 = 6

Multiples:
Numbers obtained by multiplying by integers.
Example: Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24...

LCM (Least Common Multiple):
Smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
Method: Prime factorization, take all primes with highest exponents.
Example: LCM of 12 and 18
12 = 2² × 3
18 = 2 × 3²
LCM = 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36

Relationship between GCD and LCM:
GCD(a,b) × LCM(a,b) = a × b
Example: GCD(12,18) × LCM(12,18) = 6 × 36 = 216 = 12 × 18 ✓

Divisibility Rules:
By 2: Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
By 3: Sum of digits divisible by 3
By 4: Last two digits divisible by 4
By 5: Last digit is 0 or 5
By 6: Divisible by both 2 and 3
By 9: Sum of digits divisible by 9
By 10: Last digit is 0
