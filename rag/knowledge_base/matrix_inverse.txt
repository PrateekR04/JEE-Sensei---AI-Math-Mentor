TOPIC: Inverse of a Matrix (JEE Level)

Inverse of a matrix A is denoted by A⁻¹ such that:
AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I

A matrix has an inverse only if:
det(A) ≠ 0

Formula for inverse of 2×2 matrix:

If A = [ a  b ]
        [ c  d ]

Then,
A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) * [  d  -b ]
                   [ -c   a ]

where det(A) = ad - bc

Properties:
(A⁻¹)⁻¹ = A
(AB)⁻¹ = B⁻¹A⁻¹
(Aᵀ)⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ

Used to solve system of equations:
AX = B  →  X = A⁻¹B
