Optimization Problems (JEE Level)

Finding Maximum and Minimum Values Using Calculus

Method - First Derivative Test:

1. Find f'(x)
2. Set f'(x) = 0 and solve for critical points
3. Test intervals around critical points:
   - If f'(x) changes from + to -, then maximum
   - If f'(x) changes from - to +, then minimum

Method - Second Derivative Test:

1. Find f'(x) and f''(x)
2. Set f'(x) = 0 to find critical points x = c
3. Evaluate f''(c):
   - If f''(c) < 0, then c is a local maximum
   - If f''(c) > 0, then c is a local minimum
   - If f''(c) = 0, test is inconclusive (use first derivative test)

Steps for Word Problems:

1. Identify the quantity to maximize/minimize
2. Express it as a function of one variable
3. Find domain (physical constraints)
4. Find critical points using f'(x) = 0
5. Test critical points and endpoints
6. Verify answer makes physical sense

Common Optimization Problems:

1. AREA PROBLEMS
   Example: Maximize area of rectangle with perimeter P
   Let sides be x and y, then 2x + 2y = P
   y = (P - 2x)/2 = P/2 - x
   Area A = x * y = x(P/2 - x) = Px/2 - x^2
   dA/dx = P/2 - 2x = 0
   x = P/4
   Maximum area when rectangle is a square

2. DISTANCE PROBLEMS
   Minimize distance = minimize distance^2 (easier to differentiate)

3. COST/REVENUE PROBLEMS
   Profit = Revenue - Cost
   Maximum profit when d(Profit)/dx = 0

Example: Maximize f(x) = x(10-x)

Step 1: f(x) = 10x - x^2

Step 2: f'(x) = 10 - 2x

Step 3: Set f'(x) = 0
   10 - 2x = 0
   x = 5

Step 4: f''(x) = -2 < 0, so x = 5 is maximum

Step 5: f(5) = 5(10-5) = 25

Answer: Maximum value is 25 at x = 5

Absolute (Global) Extrema on [a,b]:
1. Find all critical points in (a,b)
2. Evaluate f at critical points and endpoints a, b
3. Largest value is absolute maximum
4. Smallest value is absolute minimum
