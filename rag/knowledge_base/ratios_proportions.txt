Ratios and Proportions

Ratio:
A ratio compares two quantities.
Forms: a:b, a/b, or "a to b"
Example: 3:4 means for every 3 of one thing, there are 4 of another.

Simplifying Ratios:
Divide both parts by their GCD.
Example: 12:18 = 2:3 (divided by 6)

Proportion:
A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
Form: a/b = c/d or a:b = c:d

Cross Multiplication:
If a/b = c/d, then a × d = b × c
Example: If 2/3 = x/12
2 × 12 = 3 × x
24 = 3x
x = 8

Direct Proportion:
When one quantity increases, the other increases at the same rate.
y = kx (where k is constant)
Example: If 5 pens cost $10, how much do 8 pens cost?
5/10 = 8/x → x = 16

Inverse Proportion:
When one quantity increases, the other decreases.
xy = k (where k is constant)
Example: If 4 workers do a job in 6 days, how long for 3 workers?
4 × 6 = 3 × x → x = 8 days

Solving Ratio Problems:
Example: Divide 100 in the ratio 2:3
Sum of parts = 2 + 3 = 5
First part = (2/5) × 100 = 40
Second part = (3/5) × 100 = 60

Example: The ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. If there are 24 boys, how many girls?
3:5 = 24:x
3x = 5 × 24 = 120
x = 40 girls

Unit Rate:
A ratio with denominator 1.
Example: 120 miles in 3 hours = 40 miles per hour
