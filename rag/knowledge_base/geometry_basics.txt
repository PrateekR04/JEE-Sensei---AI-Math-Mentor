Geometry Basics

Points, Lines, and Angles:
- Point: A location with no size
- Line: Extends infinitely in both directions
- Ray: Starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction
- Line Segment: A portion of a line with two endpoints

Angles:
- Acute angle: Less than 90°
- Right angle: Exactly 90°
- Obtuse angle: Between 90° and 180°
- Straight angle: Exactly 180°
- Reflex angle: Between 180° and 360°

Complementary angles: Sum to 90°
Supplementary angles: Sum to 180°

Triangles:
Types by sides:
- Equilateral: All sides equal, all angles 60°
- Isosceles: Two sides equal, two angles equal
- Scalene: No sides equal

Types by angles:
- Acute: All angles < 90°
- Right: One angle = 90°
- Obtuse: One angle > 90°

Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°

Triangle Formulas:
Area = (1/2) × base × height
Perimeter = a + b + c

Pythagorean Theorem (right triangles):
a² + b² = c² (where c is hypotenuse)

Common Pythagorean Triples:
3, 4, 5 (3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5²)
5, 12, 13
8, 15, 17
7, 24, 25

Quadrilaterals:
All have interior angles summing to 360°

Rectangle:
Area = length × width
Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Square:
Area = side²
Perimeter = 4 × side
Diagonal = side × √2

Parallelogram:
Area = base × height

Trapezoid:
Area = (1/2) × (base1 + base2) × height

Circle:
π (pi) ≈ 3.14159 ≈ 22/7
Circumference = 2πr = πd
Area = πr²
Diameter = 2 × radius

Common Circle Values:
r = 7: Circumference ≈ 44, Area ≈ 154
r = 14: Circumference ≈ 88, Area ≈ 616
r = 10: Circumference ≈ 62.8, Area ≈ 314

3D Shapes:
Cube:
Volume = side³
Surface Area = 6 × side²

Rectangular Prism (Cuboid):
Volume = length × width × height
Surface Area = 2(lw + wh + lh)

Sphere:
Volume = (4/3)πr³
Surface Area = 4πr²

Cylinder:
Volume = πr²h
Surface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh

Cone:
Volume = (1/3)πr²h
