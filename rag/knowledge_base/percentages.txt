Percentages

Definition:
A percentage is a number expressed as a fraction of 100.
Symbol: %
Example: 50% means 50/100 = 0.5

Converting Percentages:
Percentage to Decimal: Divide by 100
25% = 25/100 = 0.25
75% = 0.75
100% = 1.0
150% = 1.5

Decimal to Percentage: Multiply by 100
0.35 = 35%
0.8 = 80%
1.25 = 125%

Fraction to Percentage: Divide, then multiply by 100
1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
3/5 = 0.6 = 60%
2/3 = 0.666... = 66.67%

Finding Percentage of a Number:
Formula: (Percentage/100) × Number
Example: 20% of 80
= (20/100) × 80
= 0.20 × 80
= 16

Common Percentages to Memorize:
10% = 1/10 = 0.1
20% = 1/5 = 0.2
25% = 1/4 = 0.25
33.33% = 1/3 ≈ 0.333
50% = 1/2 = 0.5
66.67% = 2/3 ≈ 0.667
75% = 3/4 = 0.75
100% = 1

Percentage Increase:
Formula: ((New - Original) / Original) × 100
Example: Price increased from 50 to 60
= ((60-50)/50) × 100 = (10/50) × 100 = 20% increase

Percentage Decrease:
Formula: ((Original - New) / Original) × 100
Example: Price decreased from 80 to 60
= ((80-60)/80) × 100 = (20/80) × 100 = 25% decrease

Finding Original Value:
If X is P% of original, then Original = X / (P/100)
Example: 30 is 25% of what number?
= 30 / 0.25 = 120
