## Age Problems
Pattern: "A is X years older/younger than B", "In Y years, ages will be..."
Variables:
- Current age of each person
Equations:
- Age difference: a = b + X or a = b - X
- Future condition: a + Y = k*(b + Y)
- Past condition: a - Y = k*(b - Y)

Example:
"A father is 30 years older than son. In 5 years, father is twice son's age."
Let f = father's current age, s = son's current age
f = s + 30
f + 5 = 2*(s + 5)
Solution: s = 25, f = 55

## Money/Cost Problems
Pattern: "N items of type A and M items of type B cost total T"
Variables:
- Cost per unit of each item type
Equations:
- Linear combinations: Na + Mb = T

Example:
"5 pens and 3 notebooks cost ₹120. 3 pens and 5 notebooks cost ₹140."
Let p = cost of pen, n = cost of notebook
5*p + 3*n = 120
3*p + 5*n = 140
Solution: p = 7.5, n = 27.5

---

## Speed-Distance-Time Problems
Formula: distance = speed × time, or d = v × t
Pattern: "Travels D km at speed v", "Takes T hours more/less at different speed"
Variables:
- Speed, time, or distance (whichever is unknown)
- Latent variables: if distance not given, use D

Example:
"Train travels 120 km. At 10 km/h more speed, takes 1 hour less."
Let v = original speed
120/v - 120/(v+10) = 1
Solution: v = 30 km/h

---

## Work & Time Problems
Formula: Rate = 1/time, Combined work rate = sum of rates
Pattern: "A completes in X days, B in Y days, together?"
Variables:
- Time to complete together (t)
Equations:
- 1/X + 1/Y = 1/t

Example:
"A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long together?"
Let t = time together
1/10 + 1/15 = 1/t
Solution: t = 6 days

---

## Digit Problems (Two-digit numbers)
Number representation: N = 10*tens + units
Reversed number: N' = 10*units + tens
Pattern: "Sum of digits is S", "Reversed number is K more/less"
Variables:
- tens digit (x), units digit (y)
Equations:
- x + y = S (sum of digits)
- 10*y + x = 10*x + y + K (reversed relationship)

Example:
"Sum of digits is 9. Reversed number is 27 more."
Let x = tens, y = units
x + y = 9
10*y + x = 10*x + y + 27
Simplify: 9*y - 9*x = 27 → y - x = 3
Solution: x = 3, y = 6, Number = 36

---

## Mixture Problems
Pattern: "Mix solutions of concentration X% and Y% to get Z%"
Formula: C1*V1 + C2*V2 = C_final*(V1 + V2)
Variables:
- Volumes of each solution

Example:
"Mix 30% acid with 50% acid to get 20L of 35% acid"
Let x = liters of 30%, y = liters of 50%
x + y = 20
0.30*x + 0.50*y = 0.35*20
Solution: x = 15, y = 5

---

## Ratio & Proportion Problems
Pattern: "Ratio of A to B is m:n", "If A increased by X..."
Variables:
- Actual values as multiples of ratio unit

Example:
"Ages in ratio 3:5, sum is 40"
Let ages be 3k and 5k
3k + 5k = 40
k = 5
Ages: 15 and 25

---

## Product/Nonlinear Problems
Pattern: "Sum is S and product is P"
Variables:
- Two numbers x and y
Equations:
- x + y = S (linear)
- x*y = P (nonlinear)
Note: Substitution method: y = S - x, then x*(S-x) = P

Example:
"Sum of two numbers is 20, product is 96"
x + y = 20
x*y = 96
Substitution: x*(20-x) = 96 → x² - 20x + 96 = 0
Solution: x = 12 or 8, y = 8 or 12

---

## Optimization Problems (Calculus)
Pattern: "Maximum/minimum area/volume given constraint"
Method:
1. Define objective function f(x)
2. Express constraint as equation
3. Substitute constraint into objective
4. Find critical points: f'(x) = 0
5. Verify max/min with second derivative

Example:
"Rectangle with perimeter 20, maximize area"
Let length = x, width = y
Constraint: 2x + 2y = 20 → y = 10 - x
Objective: Area = x*y = x*(10-x) = 10x - x²
f'(x) = 10 - 2x = 0 → x = 5
Maximum area = 5*5 = 25

---

## Probability Problems
Types:
- Binomial: P(k successes in n trials) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
- Without replacement: Update probabilities after each draw
- Conditional: P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
- Bayes: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)

Example:
"3 coin flips, probability of exactly 2 heads"
n = 3, k = 2, p = 0.5
P = C(3,2) * (0.5)² * (0.5)¹ = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.375

---

## Arithmetic Word Problems (Direct Computation)
Pattern: Profit/loss, simple interest, percentages
No equations needed - direct formula application

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
Simple Interest = (P * R * T) / 100
Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100

Example:
"Buy at ₹40/kg, sell at ₹50/kg, profit on 20kg?"
Profit per kg = 50 - 40 = 10
Total profit = 10 * 20 = ₹200
