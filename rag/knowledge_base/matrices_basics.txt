TOPIC: Matrices Basics (JEE Level)

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Matrix notation:
A = [a_ij] of order m × n
where m = number of rows, n = number of columns

Types of matrices:
- Row matrix: 1 × n
- Column matrix: m × 1
- Square matrix: n × n
- Zero matrix: all elements are zero
- Identity matrix I: diagonal elements are 1, rest are 0

Matrix addition:
A + B is defined only if both have same order.
(A + B)_ij = a_ij + b_ij

Scalar multiplication:
(kA)_ij = k * a_ij

Matrix multiplication:
If A is m×n and B is n×p, then AB is m×p
(AB)_ij = Σ a_ik * b_kj

Important properties:
- AB ≠ BA (not commutative)
- A(B + C) = AB + AC
- (AB)C = A(BC)

Transpose:
(Aᵀ)_ij = a_ji

Properties of transpose:
(A + B)ᵀ = Aᵀ + Bᵀ
(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ
