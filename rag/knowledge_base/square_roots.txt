Square Roots and Radicals

Definition:
The square root of a number x is a value y such that y² = x.
Symbol: √x or x^(1/2)

Properties:
- √(a × b) = √a × √b
- √(a / b) = √a / √b
- (√a)² = a
- √(a²) = |a| (absolute value)
- √0 = 0
- √1 = 1

Perfect Squares (memorize these):
√1 = 1
√4 = 2
√9 = 3
√16 = 4
√25 = 5
√36 = 6
√49 = 7
√64 = 8
√81 = 9
√100 = 10
√121 = 11
√144 = 12
√169 = 13
√196 = 14
√225 = 15
√256 = 16
√289 = 17
√324 = 18
√361 = 19
√400 = 20

How to Calculate Square Root:
Method 1 - Prime Factorization:
Example: √144
1. Factor 144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2⁴ × 3²
2. Take half of each exponent: 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12
3. Answer: √144 = 12

Method 2 - Estimation:
Example: √50
1. Find nearest perfect squares: 49 < 50 < 64
2. √49 = 7 and √64 = 8
3. Since 50 is closer to 49, √50 ≈ 7.07

Simplifying Square Roots:
√18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2
√72 = √(36 × 2) = √36 × √2 = 6√2
√48 = √(16 × 3) = √16 × √3 = 4√3
√75 = √(25 × 3) = √25 × √3 = 5√3

Cube Roots:
∛x means finding y such that y³ = x
∛8 = 2 (because 2³ = 8)
∛27 = 3 (because 3³ = 27)
∛64 = 4 (because 4³ = 64)
∛125 = 5 (because 5³ = 125)
∛1000 = 10

nth Roots:
ⁿ√x = x^(1/n)
Example: ⁴√16 = 2 (because 2⁴ = 16)

Common Mistakes:
- √(a + b) ≠ √a + √b (WRONG!)
- √(a - b) ≠ √a - √b (WRONG!)
