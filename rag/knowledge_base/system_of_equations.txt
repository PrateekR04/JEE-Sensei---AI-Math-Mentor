System of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations with the same variables.

Standard Form:
a1x + b1y = c1
a2x + b2y = c2

For three variables:
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
a2x + b2y + c2z = d2
a3x + b3y + c3z = d3

Methods of Solving:

1. SUBSTITUTION METHOD
   Step 1: Solve one equation for one variable
   Step 2: Substitute into the other equation
   Step 3: Solve for the remaining variable
   Step 4: Back-substitute to find the first variable

   Example: Solve 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1
   From equation 2: x = y + 1
   Substitute into equation 1: 2(y+1) + y = 5
   2y + 2 + y = 5
   3y = 3
   y = 1
   x = 1 + 1 = 2
   Solution: x = 2, y = 1

2. ELIMINATION METHOD
   Step 1: Multiply equations to make coefficients of one variable equal
   Step 2: Add or subtract equations to eliminate that variable
   Step 3: Solve for the remaining variable
   Step 4: Substitute back to find other variable

   Example: Solve 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1
   Add the equations: (2x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1
   3x = 6
   x = 2
   Substitute: 2 - y = 1, so y = 1
   Solution: x = 2, y = 1

3. MATRIX METHOD (Cramer's Rule)
   For AX = B where A is coefficient matrix, X is variable vector, B is constant vector
   
   If det(A) ≠ 0, system has unique solution:
   x = Dx / D
   y = Dy / D
   
   Where:
   D = det(A) = determinant of coefficient matrix
   Dx = det(A with first column replaced by B)
   Dy = det(A with second column replaced by B)

   For 2x2 system:
   D = a1*b2 - a2*b1
   Dx = c1*b2 - c2*b1
   Dy = a1*c2 - a2*c1

Types of Solutions:
- Unique Solution: det(A) ≠ 0 (lines intersect at one point)
- No Solution: det(A) = 0 and inconsistent (parallel lines)
- Infinite Solutions: det(A) = 0 and consistent (same line)

JEE Important:
- Homogeneous system (all constants = 0) always has trivial solution (0,0,...)
- Non-trivial solution exists only if det(A) = 0
