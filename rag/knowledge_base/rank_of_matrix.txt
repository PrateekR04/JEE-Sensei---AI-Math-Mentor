TOPIC: Rank of a Matrix (JEE Level)

Rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.

Methods to find rank:
- Reduce matrix to row echelon form
- Count number of non-zero rows

For a square matrix A:
- If det(A) ≠ 0 → rank(A) = order of matrix
- If det(A) = 0 → rank(A) < order

Applications:
- Solving linear equations
- Checking consistency of system
- Finding inverse

For system AX = B:
- Unique solution if rank(A) = rank([A|B]) = n
- Infinite solutions if rank(A) = rank([A|B]) < n
- No solution if rank(A) ≠ rank([A|B])
